## Quest Star

## Overview.

- Quest platform.
- Users can complete several quests and receive points (tokens).
  - Quests include quizzes and campaign tasks for various projects.
- When a certain number of these tokens are accumulated, the NFT is minted (`ERC404`, `DN404`...).
- NFTs themselves can be bought and sold, but selling NFTs will reduce the points (tokens) by that amount.
  - Conversely, buying NFTs increases points.
- This allows users to satisfy their desire for collection and enjoy the game as if it were a gacha.
- The advantage for the project side is that it makes it easier to provide on-chain information.
  - For example, "how many NFTs a particular address has", "number of transactions", "multi-chain support", etc.

## Campaign tasks.
- Asking users to perform specific tasks, mainly on Giveaway and Airdro, is commonplace in current Web3 projects.
- Commonly used tools include [gleam](https://gleam.io/).
  - X collaboration, X Post Like and Re-Post, Discord collaboration and the resulting draw.
- Not a very on-chain specific service, so not suitable for obtaining on-chain information, e.g..
  - Information such as 'number of specific NFTs held by a specific address', 'holding period', 'number of transactions over a period of time' could be obtained to better reach the users they want to reach.
  - In addition, "multi-chain support" provides an experience that is not limited to EVMs.

## ERC404 and DN404

- A system that allows NFTs to be minted after holding a certain number of FTs.
- If the NFTs are sold, the FTs are lost.
- It can also be used for long-term holdings of NFTs or FTs themselves.

## Users.

- The campaign task itself is simple.
- The task itself is so simple that it is honestly a pain in the ass.
- Users receive points (tokens) for completing tasks, and NFTs can be issued once a certain number has been accumulated, so motivation is generated, such as completing tasks to draw gachas.
- Consideration is also given to stimulating the desire to collect NFTs by issuing NFTs in collaboration with companies.

## Concerns.

### Certain projects issue too many campaign tasks.

- As a result of this, a certain number of tokens should be deposited when campaign tasks are carried out, as points are received too often.
- This prevents campaign tasks from being shot in vain.
- In addition to this, the deposited tokens are used to pay for gas for issuing points (tokens).
- It is expected that the speed of the aptos chain would allow for almost real-time token issuance.
