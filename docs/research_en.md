Tool for setting up Web2 and Web3 tasks.
Closest to the tool we want to create.

It also differentiates by incorporating, for example, specific contract specific data to be retrieved.
CWallet can use both Web2 and Web3 data, but differentiates by allowing more Web3-oriented data to be retrieved.

## Viralkit

A tool that allows tasks to be set up in conjunction with a number of social networking sites.

NFT or Ethereum Giveaway capable tool.

It uses a point system and can perform Airdrops, etc. on addresses with a certain number of points.

A tool that allows different tasks to be set and points to be given as rewards.
Only simple information can be incorporated into tasks with on-chain information.
Differentiates by allowing NFTs, tokens to be sent and a lot of on-chain information to be acquired, as the reward is the granting of points and Discord roles.

## Conclusion.

We believe that the service we want to create is beneficial because a service similar to the service we want to create already existed, but there is no service that is more on-chain specific.
In particular, we believe that it would be a useful tool for Dapps and NFTs that use the Aptos chain, as there are few services that support the Aptos chain.
